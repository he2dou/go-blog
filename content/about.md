我是一个农村出生的80后程序员。热爱编程，喜欢探索技术的无限可能。曾在C&C++，Python，Golang等语言中畅游，写下了许多代码的旅程。每当我看到“Hello, World!”这句简单而又充满意义的输出时，都感到一股自豪和喜悦

## About Hugo

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and
configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. With its
amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
